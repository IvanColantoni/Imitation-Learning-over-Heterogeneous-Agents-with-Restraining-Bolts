A common problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL) is that the reward function is hard to express. This can be overcome by resorting to Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), which consists in first obtaining a reward function from a set of execution traces generated by an expert agent, and then making the learning agent learn the expert’s behavior –this is known as Imitation Learning (IL)
